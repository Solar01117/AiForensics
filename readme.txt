To run the program:

Click the run PyCharm button!

When presented, there will be a GUI that is popped up on your screen, simply choose an image. From here, you can choose to see the noise variance, color distribution, or even a prediction analysis.

You can do this with whatever image you like, and using everything combined you can use your own analysis to see if the image is artificially generated or not.

Windows will pop up with benchmark times if you'd like to see those as well.

Click quit to safely close out of the application.
